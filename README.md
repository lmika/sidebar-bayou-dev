# Sidebar For Bayou

Sidebar for Bayou is a Micro.blog plugin that adds a sidebar to a blog using [Bayou Theme](https://github.com/MattSLangford/Bayou-Theme), by Matt Langford. This can be used to show your [blog-roll](https://www.manton.org/2024/03/11/recommendations-and-blogrolls.html), links, and pretty much anything you can imagine going into a sidebar.

For an example of how this looks on a blog, visit [the example site](https://sidebar-for-bayou.micro.blog/).
